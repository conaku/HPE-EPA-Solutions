# This is the default ansible 'hosts' file.
#
# It should live in /etc/ansible/hosts
#
#   - Comments begin with the '#' character
#   - Blank lines are ignored
#   - Groups of hosts are delimited by [header] elements
#   - You can enter hostnames or ip addresses
#   - A hostname/ip can be a member of multiple groups

# Ex 1: Ungrouped hosts, specify before any group headers.

## green.example.com
## blue.example.com
## 192.168.100.1
## 192.168.100.10

# Ex 2: A collection of hosts belonging to the 'webservers' group

## [webservers]
## alpha.example.org
## beta.example.org
## 192.168.1.100
## 192.168.1.110

# If you have multiple hosts following a pattern you can specify
# them like this:

## www[001:006].example.com

# Ex 3: A collection of database servers in the 'dbservers' group

## [dbservers]
## 
## db01.intranet.mydomain.net
## db02.intranet.mydomain.net
## 10.25.1.56
## 10.25.1.57

# Here's another example of host ranges, this time there are no
# leading 0s:

## db-[99:101]-node.example.com

#This is the spark master IP address
[spark-master]
15.213.95.216

#These are the spark slaves machine IP addresses
[spark-workers]
15.213.95.217
15.213.95.218

#These are IP of all the nodes
[cluster-nodes]
15.213.95.216
15.213.95.217
15.213.95.218

#IP of jenkins Master
[jenkins-master]
15.213.95.214

#IP address of machine where zeppelin needs to be installed
[zeppelin-node]
15.213.95.216

#IP address of machine where cassandra needs to be installed
[cassandra-node]
15.213.95.217

#IP address of the spark slaves that needs to be added to the existing cluster
[scale-nodes]
15.213.95.210

#IP address of the spark slaves that needs to be removed from the existing cluster
[remove-nodes]
15.213.95.210
